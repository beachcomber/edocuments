# edocuments
Simple api tech test for edocuments.

I have tried to keep this as simple as possible.  The only shortcut I took was to link to the Bootstrap css cdn to bring in some half senisible styling.

All code is within a single html page with some basic styling at the top and the javascript in its traditional place at the foot of the page.

Kind Regards,

Robert Wakeford
